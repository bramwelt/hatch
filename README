Hatch
=====

Hatch is a toy compiler for simple prefix math expresions.

More formally, Hatch is a Recursive-Descent LL(1) Parser hand written in
C.

There are bugs, and the grammar isn't explicit enough.
There are no variables, files, or anything fancy; only a
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop).

Hatch only works on integers.

The operators are:

- `*`, `/`
- `+`, `-`

To exit the REPL use `Ctrl-D` or `Ctrl-C`.
